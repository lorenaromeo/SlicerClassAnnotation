## Class Annotation

Module for 3D Slicer allowing annotation of medical image datasets.
This tool allows users to upload and explore medical imaging data (e.g. NRRD, NIfTI, DICOM) and assign class labels to each case. It supports two data formats: flat, in which all images are stored in a single folder, and hierarchical, in which each patient has its own subfolder.

Annotation results are automatically saved in a CSV file and an output folder is created in which patients are grouped by class. 

Two review modes designed to minimise classification errors are included: a random review mode, which automatically opens a number of cases per class, and a manual review mode, which allows users to select specific patients and change the previously assigned class.
